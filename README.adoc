=== `tryEach(array)`
```javascript
const {tryEach} = require('arrayp');
```
Runs each `Promise` in the series. It stops at the first `Promise` that resolves successfully and returns a promise which resolves to that value. If all promises fail, it returns a promise which is rejected with the error returned by the final item in the series.

arrayp.tryEach([
